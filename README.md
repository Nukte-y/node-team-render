## Description
This is a command-line application that allows a user to generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each member of a software engineering team. The application gathers information about the team members using prompts and then generates an HTML file based on that information. It includes classes for each type of team member (Employee, Manager, Engineer, and Intern), which are used to create objects for each team member.

## Usage
To use the application, follow these steps:

1. Run the command `node index.js`.
2. Follow the prompts to input information about your team members.
3. Once all prompts are completed, the HTML file will be generated in the current directory.
